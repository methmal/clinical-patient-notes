Some weights of the model checkpoint at /remote/vgatr_ur_temp/data/pretrained_models/deberta-base/base were not used when initializing DebertaModel: ['lm_predictions.lm_head.LayerNorm.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.LayerNorm.weight', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.dense.bias', 'config']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DebertaModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DebertaModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
